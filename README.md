# File Pumper
A very basic bulk file creator and renamer CLI application.

Big big features:
 - Create unlimited number of files into the directory where the program is executed with random name and extension.
 - Rename all the files inside the folder where the program is executed into a standard `{extension}_{number}.{extension}`
